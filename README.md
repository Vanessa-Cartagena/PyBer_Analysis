# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 

Our analysis's goal is to provide a DataFrame that summarizes the ride-sharing data by city type, which includes urban, suburban, and rural areas. We produced a multi-line graph that displays the total weekly fares for each of the city types using the information we acquired from our analysis throughout the module. The outcomes ought to demonstrate how the facts vary and how PyBer's decision-makers might make advantage of such variations.

### Resources 
city_data.csv, PyBer_ride_data.csv, ride_data.csv
Python, Jupyter NoteBook, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Results 

Below are the results from the analysis of the ride-sharing data among the different city types.

   * Urban cities have the highest number of rides, total drivers, and total fares. 
   * Rural cities have the lowest number of rides, total drivers, and total fares. 
   * Urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. 
   * Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. 
   * Suburban cities results in all categories have been in between rural and urban cities.

## Summary 

When comparing the study of the various ride-sharing city types, there are various elements to take into account, such the trip time, population, city size, etc. Riders from rural areas might have to drive further to reach their destinations than riders from urban areas, where the majority of needs are met nearby. Because there is more parking available, there is less traffic, and there is less access to public transportation in a rural area than in an urban metropolis, people are more likely to own vehicles. That might also be the cause of the increased average fare. For a more fair price, businesses would need to take these variables into account.
