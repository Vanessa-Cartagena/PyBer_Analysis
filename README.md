# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 

Our analysis's goal is to provide a DataFrame that summarizes the ride-sharing data by city type, which includes urban, suburban, and rural areas. We produced a multi-line graph that displays the total weekly fares for each of the city types using the information we acquired from our analysis throughout the module. The outcomes ought to demonstrate how the facts vary and how PyBer's decision-makers might make advantage of such variations.

### Resources
